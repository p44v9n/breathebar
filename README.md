# Deep Breath
A macOS app to calm your mind

[https://deepbreath.ju.mp/](https://deepbreath.ju.mp/)

## Todo
- reset animation view when clicking off / closing popover
- right click opens menu allowing you to quit app entirely
- change gif library to either [SwiftyGif](https://github.com/kirualex/SwiftyGif) (can't get working on MacOS) or Lottie or similar
    - to make it easier to track repeats of gif
    - to get rid of the horrible webview zoom/scroll bars
- ~~end gif looping after corrent number of counts~~
- ~~make menu popover scale / change size correctly~~

## Roadmap

- MVP: gif animation to guide x number of deep breaths
- Change default amount
- Add launch on login
- Add automatic updates
- Choose from range of animations
- Customise animation / breathing timing
- Add audio cues
- Add reminders (automatically pop up every x hours when Mac is on)
- Add contextual reminders (e.g. automatically pop up before a calendar event)
- Add dark mode
